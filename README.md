# Climate-Change-with-Machine-Learning
ClimateWins is a European non-profit company interested in finding out if Machine Learning can be used to predict climate change in Europe and the World. Several different types of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms were tested to determine if any tools are available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe.

ClimateWins ultimately wants to:

  -Find new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years. 
  
  -Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe. 
  
  -Determine whether unusual weather patterns are increasing. 
  
  -Generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends. 
  
  -Determine the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years.

  # Machine Learning Algorithms Tested

Clustering: A technique in unsupervised learning that groups similar data points based on their features, helping to identify patterns and structures in the data.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): A model inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes that process data through non-linear transformations to solve complex problems like classification or regression.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A specialized type of ANN for image and spatial data, using convolutional layers to detect patterns, features, and spatial hierarchies in images or videos.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): A framework where two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) compete to improve the generation of synthetic data, often used for image generation or data augmentation.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

# Thought Experiments

1. Generate more accurate weather predictions using a generative adverserial network (GAN).  The GAN could be trained on historical satellite and radar images to generate synthetic but realistic weather scenarios

2. Detect and classify unusual weather events using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which would analyze satellite images and identify storms and climate events.

3. Using an optimized Random Forest we could identify weather features and climate predictors which may help indicate safer and more pleasant areas of Europe in which to live.

# Recommendation

ClimateWins should prioritize GAN and CNN optimization to advance weather prediction capabilities.  This approach:

   -Achieved the highest accuracy and had the lowest loss across all experiments
   
   -Aligns with core organizational goals
   
   -It represents the most strategic path to high-impact, data-driven results

  Data Needs:  
  
   -Comprehensive historical weather datasets for more areas in Europe
      
   -Historical weather satellite and radar images from around Europe

  Next Steps:
  
  1. Refine CNN using Bayesian optimization to maximize performance and generalization 
       
  2. Train CNN with GAN-generated data to boost accuracy and robustness
     
  3. Gather and prepare additional real-world weather data to improve model reliability
